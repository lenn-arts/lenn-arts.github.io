I am a machine learning Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. Matei Ciocarlie and Prof. Carl Vondrick. I am broadly interested in deep learning, 3D computer vision, and robotics. In particular, I am interested in building methods that can learn generalizable, multimodal, robust, and controllable neural scene representations of the world that allow embodied agents to reason about their environment with common sense. Naturally, robot perception, interaction, and manipulation are applications of these methods.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked on dynamic neural fields with Prof. Hod Lipson in Columbia's Creative Machines Lab.
I was also a Visiting Research Fellow at MIT CSAIL, where I worked on OOD robustness for language and vision models with Prof. Dylan Hadfield-Menell. Prior to that, I worked on quantum machine learning for high-energy physics at IBM Research advised by Dr. Panos Barkoutsos in collaboration with CERN. At IBM, I also held several positions in ML engineering, data science, and AI governance.

I have been a Fellow of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and an ERP Scholar of the German Government. 

<p style='text-color:#fc9803'>**I am looking for motivated undergraduate and master's students with a strong background in machine learning or computer vision interested in conducting research. Projects can begin in Summer or Fall 2025.**</p>
